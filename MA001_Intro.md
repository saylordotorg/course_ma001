## Course Syllabus for "MA001: Beginning Algebra"

In this course, you will study basic algebraic operations and concepts, as
well as the structure and use of algebra. This includes solving algebraic
equations, factoring algebraic expressions, working with rational expressions,
and graphing linear equations. You will apply these skills to solve real-world
problems (word problems). Each unit will have its own application problems,
depending on the concepts you have been exposed to. This course is also
intended to provide you with a strong foundation for intermediate algebra and
beyond. It will begin with a review of some math concepts formed in
pre-algebra, such as ordering operations and simplifying simple algebraic
expressions, to get your feet wet. You will then build on these concepts by
learning more about functions, graphing of functions, evaluation of functions,
and factorization. You will spend time on the rules of exponents and their
applications in distribution of multiplication over addition/subtraction.


### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

*   simplify and solve linear equations and expressions, including problems
    with absolute values and applications;
*   solve linear inequalities, find equations of lines, and solve
    application problems;
*   add, subtract, multiply, and divide various types of polynomials;
*   factor polynomials, and simplify square roots; and
*   evaluate, simplify, multiply, divide, add, and subtract rational
    expressions, and solve basic applications of rational expressions.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:

*   have access to a computer;
*   have continuous broadband Internet access;
*   have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software
(e.g., Adobe Reader or Flash);
*   have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer;
*   have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt, .xls, etc.);
*   have competency in the English language; and

### Course Information

Welcome to **MA001: Beginning Algebra**. General information
about this course and its requirements can be found below.

**Course Designer:** Frank Appiah and Mark Arnold

**Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of
different free, online&nbsp;materials. The core of this course makes use of all
the materials originally structured by the Washington State Board for Community
and Technical Colleges. In particular, this course uses the following:

*   Tyler Wallace’s [_Beginning and Intermediate Algebra_,
        2<sup>nd</sup> edition](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SAYLOR-MA001-TEXT.pdf)&nbsp;(PDF)
*   Tyler Wallace’s _[Beginning Algebra Lab Notebook](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/beginning-algebra-lab-notebook.pdf)_&nbsp;(PDF)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course,
you will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. Each
unit consists of subunits with videos on each topic. Each unit concludes with a
homework problem set of varied lengths and a practice test. Also available for
each unit is a practice set that you can use to further your understanding of
the concepts. You will also need to complete the following:

*   Unit 1 Assignments
*   Unit 1 Practice Test
*   Unit 2 Assignments
*   Unit 2 Practice Test
*   Unit 3 Assignments
*   Unit 3 Practice Test
*   Unit 4 Assignments
*   Unit 4 Practice Test
*   Unit 5 Assignments
*   Unit 5 Practice Test
*   **Final Exam**

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. However,
in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to work through the
homework, practice exams, and problem sets listed above.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the
timed, two-hour final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
**104 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These
should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories to determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. For example, Unit
1 should take you 13 hours. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Monday night, Subunit
1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night, Subunit 1.3 (a total of 3 hours) on
Wednesday night, and so forth.

**Tips/Suggestions:** The course has been organized so that you
will learn the concepts you need for the succeeding unit in the preceding unit.
It is essential that you take notes while watching the videos and completing
the readings as you progress through the course. In addition, take the
homework, practice test, and practice work seriously.
