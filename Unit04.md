-   **Unit 4: Factoring Polynomials**  

    *This unit expands on what you learned in Unit 3. In Unit 4, you
    will learn to factor the greatest common factor by grouping and
    other factoring methods. Because factoring and distribution are
    opposite actions, you will be able to determine whether you have
    factored correctly by going in the opposite direction, which is
    distributing through multiplication.*

    **Unit 4 Time Advisory**  

    Completing this unit should take approximately 19.5 hours.  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.1: 4.25 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.2: 4 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.3: 3.75 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.4: 1.75 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 4.5: 2.75 hours  
        
     ☐    Unit 4 Assessment: 3 hours

    **Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  

    Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:

    -   remove a common factor;
    -   factor by grouping (including rearranging terms);
    -   factor special products;
    -   factor trinomials; and
    -   solve quadratic equations by factoring.

         Instructions: Read this section. When we multiply polynomials
        we are distributing across parentheses. Here we are doing the
        reverse: We are trying to write a polynomial as a product of
        factors. We will introduce several techniques, and you should
        focus on learning them all because later it will be up to you to
        match the correct technique to a given problem. Note that this
        reading also covers the material you need to know for subunits
        4.2.4 and 4.2.5.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes.
