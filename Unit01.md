-   **Unit 1: Review of Major Pre-Algebra Concepts**  

    *We begin by quickly reviewing the basics of pre-algebra concepts.
    Materials covered in this unit will be familiar to those who have
    had pre-algebra. With a little more practice of the suggested
    problems and homework, every student, regardless of previous
    background, should be able to grasp the main concepts.*

-   **1.1 Review Order of Operations**  
    -   **Reading: Tyler Wallace's *Beginning and Intermediate Algebra*,
        2<sup>nd</sup> edition: "Chapter 0, Section 0.3: Order of
        Operations"**

        Link: Tyler Wallace's *Beginning and Intermediate Algebra*,
        2<sup>nd</sup> edition: ["Chapter 0, Section 0.3: Order of
        Operations"](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SAYLOR-MA001-TEXT.pdf) (PDF)  
           
         Instructions: Please read section 0.3 to learn about order of
        operations. The assignment listed under this subunit corresponds
        to this reading. Mathematics would be useless if some people
        thought 3 + 4 x 2 = 14 and others thought 3 + 4 x 2 = 11 .
        Understanding the order of operations is the most basic (and
        important) task of the student of mathematics. Note that this
        reading also covers the material you need to know for subunits
        1.1.1-1.1.4.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes.

         Instructions: Watch this brief video. As we have already
        familiarized ourselves with distribution in subunit 1.2.3 above,
        this lesson will expand on that to combine like terms. The goal
        here is to be able to distribute and combine terms that are
        alike: terms with the same variable or group of variables and

        expressions on both sides of the equation. We must do the same
        thing to each side in order to keep the balance, otherwise we
        change the solutions to our problem.
