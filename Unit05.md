-   **Unit 5: Rational Expression**  

    *In this unit, you will learn how to evaluate rational expressions
    and perform operations such as addition, multiplication, and
    division involving rational expressions. You will apply the concept
    of multiplying rational expressions to dimensional analysis, where
    you will convert units from single/dual unit of measurement to
    another.*

    **Unit 5 Time Advisory**  

    Completing this unit should take you approximately 17.5 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 5.1: 3.25 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 5.2: 3 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 5.3: 2 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 5.4: 3 hours  
        
     ☐    Subunit 5.5: 3.25 hours  
        
     ☐    Unit 5 Assessment: 3 hours

    **Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  

    Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:

    -   evaluate rational expressions;
    -   reduce rational expressions;
    -   multiply rational expressions (with and without factoring);
    -   divide rational expressions (with and without factoring);
    -   find least common denominators;

        (PDF)  
           
         Instructions: Read this section. Rational expressions are just
        fractions and fractions of polynomials. Focus on the use of the
        rules of exponentiation and when we can cancel in fractions.
        Note that this reading will cover the material you need to know
        for subunits 5.1.1-5.1.4.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes.
