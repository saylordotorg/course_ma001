-   **Unit 3: Exponents and Polynomials**  

    *This section introduces you to the concept of evaluating exponents,
    converting scientific notations to decimal notations, and vice
    versa. You will apply these concepts to evaluating polynomial
    expressions.*

         Instructions: Read this section. Notice that a negative
        exponent in the denominator is the same as a positive exponent
        in the numerator. Conversely, a negative exponent in the
        numerator is the same as a positive exponent in the denominator.

        subunits 3.1.1.5 and 3.1.2.

         Instructions: Read this section. Scientific notation allows us
        a general idea of the size of a number with a glance at the
        exponent, instead of counting places before or after a decimal
        point. Note that this reading covers the material you need to
        know for subunits 3.2.1-3.2.4.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes.

        (PDF)  
           
         Instructions: Read this section. Dividing polynomials is just
        the same as the long division you learned in elementary school.
        It is also great practice in solidifying your skills in
        exponents and multiplication. Pay special attention to how the
        exponents work as place holders just as the digits in the 1s,
        10s, 100s, and so forth, places did for us in elementary school.
        Note that this reading covers the material you need to know for
        subunits 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 30 minutes.
