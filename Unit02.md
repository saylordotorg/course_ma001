-   **Unit 2: Solving Linear Inequalities and Graphing**  

    *In this unit, you will learn to apply the concept of solving
    equations to solve problems involving linear inequalities. You will
    also learn how to graph a straight line, use different methods to
    find the slope and intercept of a line, and interpret slope and
    intercept. You will learn more about types of straight lines.*

         Instructions: Read this section. Note the difference in meaning
        among "equal," "less than," and "less than or equal," and the
        symbols we use for these ideas. Focus on how the steps for
        solving inequalities are different than for solving equations.
        Note that this reading covers the material you need to know for
        subunits 2.1.1-2.1.2.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 30 minutes.

        operations on the terms are very similar to solving equations.
        Here, we make use of inequality instead of an equal sign. The
        inequality sign switches/flips when you multiply or divide both
        sides by a negative number.

         Instructions: Watch this five-minute video. Note that subunit
        2.1.3.2 (compound inequalities, or tripartite) is very similar
        to 2.1.3.1 (solving linear inequalities), except for the way the
        former has been structured. Bear in mind that in the former, we
        will be balancing the left center and right. This means whatever
        you decide to do to the center in order to get the variable in
        question by itself, you have to do the same to the other two
        parts of the inequality. Notice also that if you divide or
        multiply through by a negative number, then you have to flip the
        inequality signs.

         Instructions: Read this section. Parallel lines never
        intersect, which is good to know if you are looking for an
        intersection! The shortest distance from a line to something
        else is perpendicular to the line. The slopes for parallel and
        perpendicular lines have simple relationships to each other
        (which you should memorize!). Note that this reading covers the
        material you need to known for subunits 2.4.1-2.4.2.  
           
         Reading this section should take approximately 30 minutes.
